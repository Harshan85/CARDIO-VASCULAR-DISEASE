‚ù§Ô∏è Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning models to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the Cardiovascular Disease dataset.
It demonstrates a full pipeline ‚Äî from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model comparison and performance evaluation using multiple classifiers.

üß† Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide.
By analyzing health and lifestyle indicators such as age, blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, and glucose, we can build predictive models that help in early detection and prevention.

This project compares multiple ML algorithms to find the best-performing model for predicting whether a patient has cardiovascular disease.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
